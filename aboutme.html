 My name is Mahtab, and I am one of the many advocates for the wild horses and burros <br>
that reside within the  United States. 
    <br><br>
 I created this blog to shine lighy on the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) current <br>
poor system of managment of wild mustangs and burros, to discuss their welfare <br>
to promote the preservation and protection of America's wild equines and to simply raise <br>
awareness.
